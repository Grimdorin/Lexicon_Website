Encircling its base is a vast expanse of earth, seemingly a natural motte, though its origins speak of human intervention rather than nature's hand.

The Citadel's grandeur spans vast halls, accommodating over a thousand souls comfortably upon its ground floor alone.</p> <p>Aligned with the celestial dance of the twin moons, the Citadel draws power during their rare convergence, marking the onset of each new year. As the larger moon, [[Luminor (Planet)]], circles in its predictable 28-day cycle, the smaller moon, named [[Trixis (Planet)]] and slower yet synchronizing annually, joins its counterpart in an auspicious alignment. In this fleeting moment, the Citadel's very essence absorbs lunar energies, coveted by seekers from distant lands who yearn for its mystic potential. Though settlements sprout nearby, none are content to dwell merely adjacent; all aspire to ascend within, beneath, or above its storied walls.</p> <p>Over time, the hill beneath the Citadel has been excavated, forming [[Moon Hollow]], a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and ambition. Yet entry into the Citadel is not granted to all who seek knowledge. Only those deemed worthy may cross its threshold, for within lies the repository of ages, where scholars, sages, and academics converge. Countless floors house immeasurable wisdom, culminating in the sacred chambers of the [[Archivist Arcane]], accessible only by external elevators guided by stone golems.</p> <p>While the lower floors bustle with scholarly activity, reaching the pinnacle demands more than mere determination. Two smaller elevators ferry the fortunate few to the zenith, where the heart of the Citadel beats with the pulse of enlightenment. Despite internal staircases, the arduous climb discourages all but the most determined from scaling its heights.</p> <p>Spanning [[Moon Hollow]], a solitary bridge stands as a bastion of defense, rendering the Citadel impregnable, a testament to [[Aldor]]'s foresight and the enduring legacy of the Aldorian Citadel.</p>"},{"location":"02_Location/Aldorian%20Citadel/#notable-locations","title":"Notable Locations","text":""},{"location":"02_Location/Aldorian%20Citadel/#the-gatehouse","title":"The Gatehouse","text":"<p>The gatehouse of the Aldorian Citadel stands as a formidable bastion, its towering structure a testament to the Citadel's unwavering strength and resolve.

The construction of [[Moon Hollow]] and the subsequent deconstruction of the surrounding wall have reshaped the landscape, rendering the original fortifications obsolete. In their place, a small castle has arisen next to the gatehouse, its stout walls and watchtowers offering additional protection to the Citadel's approach.</p> <p>Situated nearly 400 feet from the main Citadel, the gatehouse commands a sizable courtyard, a buffer zone between the Citadel's inner sanctum and the outside world.
