Amber is a fossilized resin, typically golden to orange-brown in color, formed over hunderds of years from the sap of ancient trees. It often contains trapped insects or plant matter, offering glimpses into prehistoric ecosystems. Valued for its beauty and rarity, it is prized in jewelry and ornamental objects. Near the city of [[Insa Alora]], amber may be found, offering a glimpse into the ancient history of the region.
