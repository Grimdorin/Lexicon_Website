### Shield of Sirind

_Legendary Item (tower shield), requires attunement_

**Description**: The Shield of Sirind is a massive tower shield crafted from Laidir, a rare and legendary material known for its exceptional durability and unique black sheen akin to a darkened form of mythril. The shield is adorned with intricate etchings of ancient runes that faintly glow with a protective aura.

**Attributes**:

- **Unyielding Defense**: While wielding the Shield of Sirind, you gain a +3 bonus to your Armor Class.
- **Tower of Strength**: The shield has 3 charges. As a reaction when you or a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can expend 1 charge to reduce the damage by 1d12 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). The shield regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
- **Laidir's Ward**: You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage while you are attuned to the shield.
- **Tower Shield Mastery**: While wielding this shield, you can use a bonus action to provide half cover (+2 AC) to yourself and any creature directly behind you until the start of your next turn.

**Special Properties**:

- **Legendary Resistance**: If you fail a saving throw while attuned to the Shield of Sirind, you can choose to succeed instead once per day.
- **Commanding Presence**: As an action, you can slam the Shield of Sirind onto the ground, creating a shockwave in a 30-foot cone originating from you. Each creature of your choice must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw, taking 4d10 force damage and being knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and not being knocked prone on a successful one. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

_Note_: The Shield of Sirind is a symbol of unbreakable defense and legendary resilience, crafted for heroes who stand against overwhelming odds and protect those who cannot protect themselves.
