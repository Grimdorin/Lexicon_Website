**Item (vial), uncommon**

_Description_: A vial of Nalim is a small glass container filled with a potent acid known for its ability to dissolve even the toughest materials on contact. The liquid inside is a deep, translucent green, emitting a faint hiss as it reacts with the air.

**Attributes**:

- **Acidic Burst**: As an action, you can throw this vial at a creature or object within 20 feet of you. Make a ranged attack against the target. On a hit, the vial shatters, and the target takes 2d6 acid damage.
- **Corrosive Residue**: A creature that takes damage from this vial must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have its armor or natural armor permanently damaged, reducing its AC by 1 until repaired.

_Note_: The vial of Nalim is a single-use item. Once thrown and the acid inside used, the vial is rendered empty and can't be refilled or reused.
