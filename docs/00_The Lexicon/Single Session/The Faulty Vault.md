Introduction to [[Augurian Vault]]. 

The security system consists of a combo of Key and Coin:

The key is in possession of a vault master of [[Augurian Vault]].
The coin is in possession of the owner of the personal/ family/ clan vault.

A dwarven enchanter has received notice that his vault has been opened without his consent.
Yet the dwarf is very old and he needs help from the players to go to [[Augurian Vault]] and check the security.
The dwarf tells them about the days when hammer and chisel was enough to create masterworks.

The players receive the security coin from the elder dwarf. Unbeknownst to them, the coin itself is enchanted/ cursed.

The players need to insert the coin to enter the vault and might notice a red glow appearing.

The first part is some sort of workshop. The opening to the next room is guarded by 2 statues. An inscription states:
> The right tool can open every door.

The statues should be given an hammer and a chisel. Yet even this solution will initiate combat as the coin influences the statues.

Dependent on which items are given, the statblocks of the statues change.
These statues should be easy to stop as the players need their resources for later.

The next room is some kind of library with lots of books and blueprints. On the table is a manual to create stone golems.

The next room is the main part of the vault. A lot of treasure can be found here. This treasure is guarded by a winged stone golem. This shows the expertise of the elder dwarf as this is very advanced.

Once the characters enter the room the stone golems activates and will try to destroy the players.

Once the stone golem is destroyed, [[Augurian Vault]] will cleanse the vault and move the treasure to a new vault.

The players are allowed to keep the enchanted coin.

This is a [[Midas Coin]]. The devil will contact the player holding the coin.
