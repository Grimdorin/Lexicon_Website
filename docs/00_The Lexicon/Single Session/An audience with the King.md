The king of [[City of Aktunk]] requires bodyguards for his next public appearance.

A meeting is planned around 18.00.

Yet before the meeting can take place, the players are notified that the king as been assassinated.

The players need to figure out how this could have happened. A friends states that, to enter the Palace of the King, one needs to answer the riddle of the [[Sphinx]].

The riddle of the [[Sphinx]]:

> "Who killed the King today?"

The players do not know the answer and the [[Sphinx]] will pretend to slay them with a spell.
Yet the players day has reset. And they will live through the same day until they figure out who the assassin is and stop them.

If they know the name and go to the [[Sphinx]] to answer the riddle, then the players can search the chambers of the King, check his body. There should be an item to reset the day as the [[Sphinx]] did not reset the day.

If the characters camp near the [[Sphinx]], then the assassin gets the following question:
> "Who will kill the King today?"

and the assassin will answer with 
> "I will"

If the assassin is stopped and the players go to the [[Sphinx]], then the answer should be:
> Nobody
