### **Ilvara, the Weeping Oracle** (The Return of the Lightbringers)

_Setting: The players stand before Ilvara, the Weeping Oracle, in her shadowed temple. Moonlight streams through a shattered skylight, casting eerie patterns across the floor. Ilvara, her face hidden beneath a hood, weeps silently, her tears glowing with the light of the moon. As the players approach, she speaks, her voice a soft, mournful whisper._

**Ilvara**: _"The future... it is not as it was. I see flames... great wings... light that should not be."_

_Her eyes, shimmering with visions, gaze into the distance, as though she sees a world beyond the present._

**Player 1**: _"What do you mean? What light?"_

**Ilvara**: _"They come... those who were lost. Beacons of the sky, bringers of light and fire. Once, they flew across the heavens, their power unmatched, their radiance a sign of hope... and of destruction."_

_Her tears fall faster, each one sending ripples of energy through the air._

**Ilvara**: _"The Lightbringers will return. Not as you know them... not as you remember. They will rise from the ashes of a forgotten age, and the world will tremble beneath their wings. They bring both salvation and ruin."_

**Player 2**: _"What are they? These Lightbringers?"_

_Ilvara's voice becomes quieter, her eyes closing in sorrow._

**Ilvara**: _"They are... the old fire. The ancient light. They are what was, and what will be again. You will know them when you see them. Their coming cannot be stopped... only prepared for."_

_The players feel a chill run through the air, and for a moment, they glimpse a visionâ€”massive, winged creatures blazing with radiant light, soaring through a sky turned to flame._

**Ilvara**: _"The time of shadows is ending... and the light will consume all."_

_She lowers her head once more, her weeping echoing softly in the silence of the temple._
