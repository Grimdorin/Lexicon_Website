## **Description**

Beloria, known in ancient times as Karak Duraz (Stronghold of the Mountain), was the ancestral seat of **[[Clan Durarrun]]**. Unlike a sprawling city, it was designed as a fortified stronghold, meant to serve as a military and political center rather than house a large population. It was nestled within the **[[Highcrag Mountains]]**, built into the mountainside with its keep perched atop a high cliff, overlooking the valley below.

The fortress was accessed through two main gates:

The Lower Gate – Positioned at the base of the stronghold, guarded by a massive stone wall.
The Higher Gate – Located further up the slope, serving as the entrance to the royal grounds and the keep.

The tallest peak near Beloria, and in the known world, is **[[Fatherstone]]** (**[[Fatherstone|Kharad-Gar]]** in dwarvish), a sacred mountain to the dwarves.

Beloria was abandoned after the infamous **[[Feast of Fallen Kin]]**, where King **[[Sigir]]** and his assembled guests were slaughtered by a demon of darkness, **[[Susundol]]**. His son, **[[Sigbar]]**, survived the massacre and later moved the dwarven capital to **[[Thalheim]]**, leaving Beloria in ruin.

### **Origin**

Built in the early ages by the ancestors of **[[Clan Durarrun]]**, Beloria was a fortress of unwavering stone and dwarven craftsmanship. Its purpose was not just defense but also to stand as a symbol of dwarven resilience and heritage. Over time, the keep became a place of power where kings ruled from the royal halls, their legacy immortalized in the **[[Hall of Ancestors]]**.
