# Aldorian Citadel
---
When the adventurers arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following text to the players:

	As the moon casts its silver glow, you catch sight of the Aldorian Citadel in the distance, a towering structure resembling a gleaming white shard against the darkened sky. Its construction appears almost supernatural, carved seamlessly from a single block of stone, alternating between marble white and dark grey hues. Each of its four sides boasts a large azure stained-glass window with intricate gold framing. Encircling its base is a vast expanse of earth, seemingly a natural motte, though its origins speak of human intervention rather than nature's hand. Activity bustles around the structure, with scholars, mages, and various other figures moving about its perimeter, hinting at the intellectual hub within.

## Description

In the dawn of the first age, [[Aldor]], a celestial human, erected the Aldorian Citadel atop a majestic hill, named the [[Hill under the Moon]], defying mortal comprehension. The magnitude of its stones and the enormity of its structure bewilder all who gaze upon it, for no mere mortal could conceive its creation alone. Yet Aldor achieved the impossible. The Citadel's grandeur spans vast halls, accommodating over a thousand souls comfortably upon its ground floor alone.

Aligned with the celestial dance of the twin moons, the Citadel draws power during their rare convergence, marking the onset of each new year. As the larger moon, [[Luminor (Planet)]], circles in its predictable 28-day cycle, the smaller moon, named [[Trixis (Planet)]] and slower yet synchronizing annually, joins its counterpart in an auspicious alignment. In this fleeting moment, the Citadel's very essence absorbs lunar energies, coveted by seekers from distant lands who yearn for its mystic potential. Though settlements sprout nearby, none are content to dwell merely adjacent; all aspire to ascend within, beneath, or above its storied walls.

Over time, the hill beneath the Citadel has been excavated, forming [[Moon Hollow]], a testament to humanity's insatiable curiosity and ambition. Yet entry into the Citadel is not granted to all who seek knowledge. Only those deemed worthy may cross its threshold, for within lies the repository of ages, where scholars, sages, and academics converge. Countless floors house immeasurable wisdom, culminating in the sacred chambers of the [[Archivist Arcane]], accessible only by external elevators guided by stone golems.

While the lower floors bustle with scholarly activity, reaching the pinnacle demands more than mere determination. Two smaller elevators ferry the fortunate few to the zenith, where the heart of the Citadel beats with the pulse of enlightenment. Despite internal staircases, the arduous climb discourages all but the most determined from scaling its heights.

Spanning [[Moon Hollow]], a solitary bridge stands as a bastion of defense, rendering the Citadel impregnable, a testament to [[Aldor]]'s foresight and the enduring legacy of the Aldorian Citadel.



## Notable Locations

#### The Gatehouse
The gatehouse of the Aldorian Citadel stands as a formidable bastion, its towering structure a testament to the Citadel's unwavering strength and resolve. Spanning the width of the bridge, wide enough to accommodate three carts abreast, the gatehouse serves as the sentinel between the Citadel and the outside world.

At its heart lies the giant gate, a massive barrier that separates the Citadel from the tumult of the world beyond. Crafted from sturdy iron and reinforced with arcane wards, the gate stands as a bulwark against intrusion, its imposing presence a warning to would-be trespassers.

Yet, as the Citadel's influence has grown, so too has its need for expansion. The construction of [[Moon Hollow]] and the subsequent deconstruction of the surrounding wall have reshaped the landscape, rendering the original fortifications obsolete. In their place, a small castle has arisen next to the gatehouse, its stout walls and watchtowers offering additional protection to the Citadel's approach.

Situated nearly 400 feet from the main Citadel, the gatehouse commands a sizable courtyard, a buffer zone between the Citadel's inner sanctum and the outside world. Here, stables bustle with activity as horses are readied for patrol, logistical platforms hum with the industry of supply management, and airship platforms stand ready to launch vessels into the skies above.

Under the vigilant watch of the spellswords, commanded by the [[Warden of the Citadel]], the courtyard teems with life and activity, a bustling thoroughfare that links the Citadel to the wider world beyond.

#### The Moon Hollow
Beneath the towering edifice of the Aldorian Citadel sprawls [[Moon Hollow]], a labyrinth of rocky outshoots and makeshift dwellings where the ebb and flow of life unfolds amidst the shadows.

Perched upon the rocky outshoots that line the hollow's sides, buildings rise like sentinels against the night sky, their weathered facades bearing testament to the passage of time. From humble abodes to ramshackle workshops, these structures cling to the rugged terrain, their occupants united by a shared existence on the fringes of society.

At the heart of the hollow lies the ring-shaped plaza, a bustling hub of activity where denizens of all walks of life converge. Here, amidst the cacophony of voices and the bustle of commerce, the faithful gather to pay homage to the celestial dance of the moons, their fervent prayers echoing into the night.

Yet, amid the throngs, three distinct groups emerge, each carving out their own place within the hollow's tangled web of alleyways and pathways.

First are the unlucky scholars, denied entry into the Citadel's hallowed halls yet driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Theirs is a life of longing and frustration, relegated to the outskirts of academia yet fueled by a relentless pursuit of enlightenment.

Next are the moon devoted, a group of extremists whose fervent devotion to the lunar alignment borders on fanaticism. For them, the celestial convergence is not merely a cause for celebration but a sacred duty, one that demands unwavering dedication and sacrifice.

Lastly, there are the greedy bunch, opportunists and profiteers who see the hollow not as a home but as a marketplace ripe for exploitation. Driven by avarice and ambition, they ply their trade in contraband and illicit goods, their fortunes rising and falling with the tide of demand.

Amidst this teeming throng, the [[Warden of the Citadel]] commands a crime-fighting force dedicated to maintaining order within the hollow's chaotic streets. With a watchful eye and a firm hand, they patrol the shadowed alleys and winding passages, their presence a beacon of authority amidst the tumult of [[Moon Hollow]]'s restless inhabitants.

#### The Council Floors
Ascending to the Citadel's uppermost heights unveils the heart of its power and governance, where the Council convenes in solemn deliberation. At the heart of this domain lies the audience room, a grand chamber adorned with tapestries depicting the Citadel's storied history and the celestial dance of the moons. Here, the council convenes to hear the pleas of petitioners and discuss matters of state, their voices echoing against the vaulted ceilings as they deliberate the Citadel's course.

Beyond the audience room lies the sanctum of the council itself, a chamber shrouded in secrecy and power. Here, the [[Archivist Arcane]], the [[Warden of the Citadel|Warden]], and the [[Archmage of the Citadel]] gather to confer, their words carrying weight beyond measure as they shape the destiny of the Citadel and its denizens.

Adjacent to the council chamber, the [[Archivist Arcane]] maintains his private quarters, a refuge of solitude and contemplation amid the tumult of governance. Here, amidst shelves lined with ancient tomes and artifacts of arcane power, the [[Archivist Arcane]] finds respite from the demands of leadership, his dreams woven with threads of forgotten lore and untold secrets.

In contrast, the [[Warden of the Citadel|Warden]]'s sleeping quarters lie near the bridge, a strategic position that reflects his role as guardian and defender of the Citadel's borders. From his chamber, he keeps watch over the bridge and its guardians, ever vigilant against threats from without.

Similarly, the [[Archmage of the Citadel]]'s sleeping quarters are nestled amidst the lower floors of the Citadel, a reflection of his role as steward of knowledge and mentor to the Citadel's scholars. Here, amid the bustling activity of academia, the [[Archmage of the Citadel]] finds solace in the pursuit of enlightenment, his dreams suffused with visions of a future shaped by wisdom and understanding.

#### The Lower Floors 
Ascending through the Aldorian Citadel's lower floors unveils a symphony of intellectual pursuit and scholarly endeavor, each level a bastion of knowledge and discovery.

At the ground level, the heart of learning beats within the Citadel's grand Education University. Here, scholars and students gather to exchange ideas, attend lectures, and delve into the vast archives of accumulated wisdom. A bustling reception desk stands as a beacon of guidance, offering assistance to newcomers and managing the flow of information and supplies that sustain the Citadel's operations.

The first floor houses the realm of Engineering, where the intricate workings of the Citadel's machinery and infrastructure are studied and refined. Towering elevators stand sentinel, their mechanical marvels facilitating passage to higher realms of the Citadel's domain. Unlike the arcane-powered mechanisms found elsewhere in the Citadel, these elevators rely on a different source of power - the tireless strength of stone golems. Stationed at each elevator, these silent sentinels stand ready to serve, their immense strength harnessed to pull the elevators skyward with steady precision.

On the second floor, scholars delve into the rich tapestry of Flora and Fauna, studying the intricacies of the natural world and its myriad inhabitants. From botany to zoology, this floor serves as a sanctuary for those seeking to unravel the mysteries of life itself.

Ascending to the third floor reveals the alchemical laboratories, where the ancient art of transmutation and transformation is practiced. Here, alchemists ply their trade, seeking to unlock the secrets of matter and energy through experimentation and discovery.

The fourth floor is dedicated to the intricate craft of Enchantments, where scholars harness the forces of magic to imbue objects with mystical properties. Runes and sigils adorn the walls, their arcane symbols weaving spells of protection and power.

Continuing upward, the fifth floor is a realm of Arcane Research, where the boundaries of magic are pushed to their limits. Here, mages and wizards delve into the esoteric arts, uncovering hidden truths and unlocking the secrets of the cosmos.

The sixth and seventh floors house the Citadel's vast libraries, repositories of knowledge spanning the breadth of history and economics. Scholars pore over ancient tomes and scrolls, seeking insight into the past and glimpses of the future.

At the pinnacle of the lower floors lies the [[Library of High Arcane]], a sanctuary of mystical lore and ancient wisdom. Here, the most esteemed scholars and mages gather to study the deepest mysteries of magic, their minds alight with the promise of discovery and enlightenment. Adjacent to the [[Library of High Arcane]], the elevators leading to the council floors can be found.

#### The Underground
Beneath the bustling activity of the Aldorian Citadel's upper floors lies a labyrinth of hidden chambers and shadowed corridors, concealed from the prying eyes of common visitors. Here, amid the depths of the underground floors, scholars delve into realms of arcane inquiry that would unsettle the most stalwart of minds.

Interplanar research, a pursuit fraught with peril and promise, finds its home within these subterranean depths. Arcane circles crackle with energy as scholars peer into the veiled mysteries of otherworldly realms, seeking to unravel the fabric of existence itself. Experiments involving planar travel and dimensional manipulation unfold in secrecy, their outcomes unknown and their consequences potentially cataclysmic.

Yet, amid the whispers of interplanar exploration, a darker current flows. Necromantic energies pulse within hidden laboratories, where forbidden rites and profane rituals stain the air with an aura of death and decay. Here, in the shadowed recesses of the underground, necromancers ply their trade, delving into the forbidden arts of life and death with reckless abandon.

Amidst the gloom, secret projects pertaining to warforged soldiers take shape, their metallic forms forged in the crucible of innovation and ambition. Engineers and artificers toil tirelessly, crafting weapons of war imbued with arcane enchantments and mechanical precision. Yet, behind closed doors, whispers of ethical dilemmas and moral quandaries echo, as the line between creator and creation blurs amidst the clatter of gears and the hiss of steam.

Within these clandestine chambers, the pulse of arcane energy is palpable, a constant reminder of the Citadel's insatiable thirst for knowledge and power. Yet, beneath the veneer of scholarly pursuit, darker forces stir, their presence felt but never fully understood, lurking in the depths like shadows waiting to be unveiled.
