# Thalheim

---

## **Description**

Thalheim, meaning "Home of the Valley", rose to prominence after the fall of **[[Beloria]]**, becoming the new capital of the dwarves. The young **[[Sigbar]]**, son of **[[Sigir]]**, was not yet of age to rule, so **[[Augur Augurian]]** was appointed as regent. As **[[Sirind]]**, Sigir’s brother, already ruled in the eastern dwarven territories, it was impossible for him to govern both kingdoms.

Thalheim is renowned for its immense gold and gem veins embedded within the surrounding mountains, making it a center of wealth and industry. The city's scale is so vast that one cannot see from one end to the other. The northwestern section is built into the mountainside, reflecting Thalheim’s status as a mining powerhouse.

In its early days, Thalheim was accessible via three bridges, spanning a deep valley and defensive moat. As the population expanded, a new southeastern district was built, creating a single massive gateway, now serving as the main entrance to the city.

Thalheim is governed as a plutocracy, with **[[Augur Augurian]]** holding the highest authority. As the Vaultmaster of the **[[Augurian Vault]]**, the largest bank in the world, he oversees both the city's wealth and its governance. Despite his power, Augur remains loyal to the royal house, ruling in **[[Sigbar]]**’s name until he comes of age.

## **Origin**

Thalheim’s foundations trace back to ancient dwarven settlements, though it only became the capital after **[[Beloria]]**’s fall. Its prosperity was driven by rich mineral resources and unparalleled infrastructure, allowing it to flourish as a hub of commerce, craftsmanship, and governance.
